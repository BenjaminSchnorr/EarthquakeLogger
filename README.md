# EarthquakeLogger

My app receives and stores information about earthquakes reported in the last two days using the USGS API. It stores the location, time, magnitude, and unique event ID for each earthquake in a SQLite database. The app also allows users to report an earthquake they have experienced by entering the relevant details. When the user submits the form, the information is saved in the database, and the phone will vibrate for a number of seconds equal to the earthquake’s magnitude. For example, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5 will cause the phone to vibrate for 5 seconds. To use the app, users can navigate between the two activities using the menu buttons—the "Add" button starts the Earthquake Report activity, and the "List" button requests and displays earthquake information from the USGS API.
